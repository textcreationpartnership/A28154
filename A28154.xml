            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:110233:236"/> have power to do ≈øuch things therein, as the Chief Iu≈øtice doth daily <hi>ex Officio,</hi> upon ≈øurmi≈øe that the parties that are to acknowledge the Fine are not able to travel to <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter</hi> for the doing thereof.

                     <p>IF any per≈øon have a de≈øire to render him≈øelf ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of di≈øpo≈øing of Lands or Tenements which are intayled upon him, and would be enabled to ≈øell, give, or bequeath them as he plea≈øeth, the cour≈øe is to procure ≈øome friend to bring a Writ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt him for this Land; or in ca≈øe where he doth ≈øell the Land, perhaps he that buyeth it, or is to have it ≈øetled upon him, ≈øhall bring the Writ again≈øt him that is to make the A≈ø≈øurance of the Land, if it be with a ≈øingle Voucher. And in this ca≈øe the Demandant (being Plaintiff in this Action) doth ≈øuppo≈øe that the Tenant (or he again≈øt whom the Writ is brought) hath no right to the Land, but that he onely (<hi>viz.</hi> the Demandant) hath right thereunto, and that the Tenant came to the Land wrongfully by means of one <hi>Hugh Hunt</hi> a ≈øtranger therein named. And to this Writ the Tenant doth appear either by Attorney or in per≈øon, and then doth enter into defence of the Land: but in Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth vouch to warant ≈øuch a man, from whom, or his Ance≈øtors, the Lands in que≈øtion are ≈øuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to come to him or his Ance≈øtors, the Ance≈øtor of which third per≈øon obliging him≈øelf and his heirs by Conveyance, to warant and make good the Title to him or them to whom it was Conveyed: and thereupon he prayeth that this Vouchee (or third per≈øon) may be called into Court to defend this Title, whereupon being called he doth appear, and ≈øeem to defend the Title, denying that the Tenant came to the land wrongfully by means of the afore≈øaid <hi>Hugh Hunt,</hi> upon which he takes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110233:262"/> I≈ø≈øue, or put him≈øelf upon the Country, whereupon the Demandant prayeth a further day to imparle or confer about the matter, which being granted unto him by the Court, at the day appointed the Vouchee, or third per≈øon afore≈øaid, by Agreement and con≈øent of the Parties comes no more into Court, but makes default, whereby judgment is given and awarded by the Court to the Demandant that he ≈øhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover again≈øt the Tenant the Lands in que≈øtion, and that the Tenant ≈øhall recover over ≈øo much Land of the third per≈øon as is ≈øufficient to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence him for the Land recovered from him, which the ≈øaid third per≈øon, or Common Vouchee, ought to have waranted and defended but ≈øuffered to be lo≈øt. And this is a Recovery in value or <hi>pro Rata.</hi> But if the Recovery be with a double Voucher, or treble Voucher, then the third per≈øon upon his appearance is to call or vouch to warant a fourth per≈øon (who mu≈øt be the Common Vouchee) and to alleadge in the ≈øame manner as the Tenant doth, and pray that ≈øuch fourth per≈øon may come in, who thereupon mu≈øt appear, and make default in ≈øuch manner as before is mentioned of the third per≈øon in the Recovery with ≈øingle Voucher. And ≈øo if there be more Vouchers. And then there mu≈øt be ≈øeveral Recoveries over in value again≈øt every one of them. But he that is la≈øt vouched or called to waranty is alwaies Common Vouchee, who is u≈øually Bag-bearer to the <hi>Cu≈øtos Brevium</hi> of the Court of Common Pleas, and hath not any Land to render in value upon the ≈øuppo≈øed war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty. And by this means grounded upon the ≈øtrict Principles of Law the fir≈øt Tenant doth willingly let go the land for the a≈ø≈øurance of the Purcha≈øor, and yet in truth hath no recompence over becau≈øe the Vouchee hath no Land to render in value.</p>

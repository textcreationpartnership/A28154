            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>THe perſons before whom Fines are to be levyed are ſuch as either take Cognizance of Fines <hi>ex Officio,</hi> and by vertue of their Office, or ſuch as are appointed and authorized thereunto. Thoſe that do it <hi>ex Officio</hi> are the Lord Chief Iuſtice for the time being of the Court of the Common Pleas, who hath power to receive and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Acknowledgment of all manner of Fines without any kind of Commiſſion, as well in any place out of the Court, as in the Court. And ſo any two of the Iuſtices of the ſame Court may do it in open Court.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that take Cognizance of Fines otherwiſe then <hi>ex Officio,</hi> are ſuch as do it by vertue of ſome Commiſſion General or Special granted unto them by the King out of Chancery.</p>
                     <p>The firſt ſort of thoſe that take and certifie Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizances of Fines by vertue of Commiſſion are Iuſtices of Aſſize, who, although they may do it by the general words of their Patent, yet they do not uſe to certifie them without a ſpecial writ of <hi>Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus poteſtatem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Iudges of both Benches and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons of the Exchequer, who do uſually firſt take the Cognizance of Fines without <hi>Dedimus poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> and afterwards Certifie the ſame upon a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus poteſtatem</hi> to warrant and juſtifie their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings therein.</p>
                     <p>The third ſort are certain, diſcreet, honeſt, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Gentlemen in the Country or place where the Cognizors which are to acknowledge the Fine reſide, who have alwaies a ſpecial writ of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus poteſtatem</hi> directed unto them, whereby they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:110233:236"/> have power to do ſuch things therein, as the Chief Iuſtice doth daily <hi>ex Officio,</hi> upon ſurmiſe that the parties that are to acknowledge the Fine are not able to travel to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> for the doing thereof. And by this Writ upon ſuch ſurmiſe power may be given to any Serjeant at Law, or to any Knight or Gentleman together to take the Cognizance of the perſons that are to be Cognizors in the Fine: And this they may take from them either altogether at once, or aſunder at ſeveral times, and in ſeveral places as they pleaſe.</p>

And if husband and wife be Cognizors, the wife ought to be examined ſolely and ſecretly, whether ſhe be content of her own free will to part with her right in the land, or whether ſhe do it by the menace and threats, or out of fear of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then the contents of the Fine muſt be read diſtinctly to her; And if the Iudge doubt of her age, he may examine her upon oath, and ſo may Commiſſioners, which being done, and the Fine read to the Cognizors they are to put their hands to the Concord. And then the Commiſſioners are

                     <p>IF any perſon have a deſire to render himſelf ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of diſpoſing of Lands or Tenements which are intayled upon him, and would be enabled to ſell, give, or bequeath them as he pleaſeth, the courſe is to procure ſome friend to bring a Writ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him for this Land; or in caſe where he doth ſell the Land, perhaps he that buyeth it, or is to have it ſetled upon him, ſhall bring the Writ againſt him that is to make the Aſſurance of the Land, if it be with a ſingle Voucher. And in this caſe the Demandant (being Plaintiff in this Action) doth ſuppoſe that the Tenant (or he againſt whom the Writ is brought) hath no right to the Land, but that he onely (<hi>viz.</hi> the Demandant) hath right thereunto, and that the Tenant came to the Land wrongfully by means of one <hi>Hugh Hunt</hi> a ſtranger therein named. And to this Writ the Tenant doth appear either by Attorney or in perſon, and then doth enter into defence of the Land: but in Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth vouch to warant ſuch a man, from whom, or his Anceſtors, the Lands in queſtion are ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to come to him or his Anceſtors, the Anceſtor of which third perſon obliging himſelf and his heirs by Conveyance, to warant and make good the Title to him or them to whom it was Conveyed: and thereupon he prayeth that this Vouchee (or third perſon) may be called into Court to defend this Title, whereupon being called he doth appear, and ſeem to defend the Title, denying that the Tenant came to the land wrongfully by means of the aforeſaid <hi>Hugh Hunt,</hi> upon which he takes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110233:262"/> Iſſue, or put himſelf upon the Country, whereupon the Demandant prayeth a further day to imparle or confer about the matter, which being granted unto him by the Court, at the day appointed the Vouchee, or third perſon aforeſaid, by Agreement and conſent of the Parties comes no more into Court, but makes default, whereby judgment is given and awarded by the Court to the Demandant that he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover againſt the Tenant the Lands in queſtion, and that the Tenant ſhall recover over ſo much Land of the third perſon as is ſufficient to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence him for the Land recovered from him, which the ſaid third perſon, or Common Vouchee, ought to have waranted and defended but ſuffered to be loſt. And this is a Recovery in value or <hi>pro Rata.</hi> But if the Recovery be with a double Voucher, or treble Voucher, then the third perſon upon his appearance is to call or vouch to warant a fourth perſon (who muſt be the Common Vouchee) and to alleadge in the ſame manner as the Tenant doth, and pray that ſuch fourth perſon may come in, who thereupon muſt appear, and make default in ſuch manner as before is mentioned of the third perſon in the Recovery with ſingle Voucher. And ſo if there be more Vouchers. And then there muſt be ſeveral Recoveries over in value againſt every one of them. But he that is laſt vouched or called to waranty is alwaies Common Vouchee, who is uſually Bag-bearer to the <hi>Cuſtos Brevium</hi> of the Court of Common Pleas, and hath not any Land to render in value upon the ſuppoſed war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty. And by this means grounded upon the ſtrict Principles of Law the firſt Tenant doth willingly let go the land for the aſſurance of the Purchaſor, and yet in truth hath no recompence over becauſe the Vouchee hath no Land to render in value.</p>
